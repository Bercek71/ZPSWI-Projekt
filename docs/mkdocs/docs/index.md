Welcome to the **Hotel Reservation System** documentation. This system enables users to browse, book, and manage hotel reservations through an intuitive and efficient web interface. It also provides an API for integrating with other systems.

## Overview

The Hotel Reservation System offers the following key features:

- **Room Booking**: Users can search for available rooms based on dates and preferences, and make a reservation.
- **Customer Management**: Hotels can manage customer information, including personal details and booking history.
- **Payment Processing**: Secure payment processing is integrated to handle transactions for reservations.
- **Admin Panel**: Administrators can view bookings, manage rooms, and monitor overall system performance.
- **REST API**: Expose endpoints to manage rooms, bookings, and customers programmatically.
